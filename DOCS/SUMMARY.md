  - Animated RGB LED news reel
  - Enhanced Play button with glowy snowy effects
  - Gallery button with Christmas artsy styling

## UI Components
- **Tech Info Panel**: Toggleable panel (⚙️ Tech button) showing WebGPU/WebGL status, Three.js version, Post-Processing, Instanced Rendering, Particle Systems, and OrbitControls.
- **Gallery Panel**: Accessible via Gallery button, displays organized view of all game assets:
  - **Entities Tab**: Christmas Light, Tree Light
  - **Blocks Tab**: Snow, Dirt, Wood, Leaves, Stone, Plank, Window blocks
  - **Structures Tab**: House structure
  - **Plants Tab**: Christmas Tree
  - Sleek card-based grid layout with hover animations
  - Tabbed interface matching Settings panel design
- **World Generation Panel**: Accessible via Play button, displays world size (64x64) and toggle switches for trees, lights, house, and hills.
- **World Loading Screen**: Full-screen loading overlay (z-index: 9999) with fully opaque background that completely blocks menu and game world view. Features:
  - Animated progress bar with shimmer effect and real-time percentage display (0-100%)
  - Dynamic status messages: "Generating terrain...", "Building structures...", "Placing trees...", "Entering world..."
  - Animated spinner with multiple rotating rings
  - Automatically hides ALL UI elements when shown (title, menu, buttons, news reel, panels)
  - Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
  - Progress tracking integrated with world generation callback system
- **Dual World System**: Separate menu world (75 block radius) and game world (150 block radius) that coexist independently.
- **News Reel**: Pill-shaped banner with multiple animated effects:
  - **Outer RGB Glow**: Flowing color spectrum border (6s animation cycle)
  - **Border Lights**: Animated Christmas light bars in black border area (20s cycle with twinkling)
  - **Inner Lights**: Radial gradient Christmas lights along content edge (16s cycle with twinkling)
  - **Dynamic Snowflakes**: JavaScript-generated snowflakes spawning at random positions, falling with rotation (6-8s duration, max 7 active)
  - **Scrolling Text**: Continuous horizontal scroll of latest updates
- **Play Button**: Glowy snowy appearance with animated snowflakes and pulsing glow.
- **Gallery Button**: Christmas artsy button with warm pink/red gradient, picture frame and sparkle decorations, and pulsing glow animation. Opens gallery panel.
- **Settings Button**: Glowy snowy appearance matching Play button style. Opens settings panel.
- **Quit Button**: Red-tinted quit button (✕ Quit) in bottom-right corner that closes the application. Uses WebView2 message communication between JavaScript and C# wrapper.
- **UI Auto-Hide System**:
  - **Countdown Timer**: 5-second countdown after splash screen automatically hides UI for immersive viewing
  - **Manual Toggle**: "Hide UI" / "Show UI" button for manual control
  - **Double-Click Wake**: Double-click anywhere on canvas to restore UI after auto-hide
  - **Interaction Blocking**: When hidden, all menu buttons are disabled with no hover effects or click interactions
  - **Complete Restoration**: UI wake properly restores all elements including news reel and audio warning positioning
- **Controls & Keybinds**:
  - **WASD Movement**: Smooth first-person movement (W/A/S/D for forward/left/backward/right)
  - **Jump**: Space bar for jumping with gravity physics
  - **Mouse Look**: Mouse movement for camera rotation (PointerLockControls)
  - **Configurable Keybinds**: Settings → Controls tab with click-to-change keybind functionality
  - **Visual Feedback**: Pulsing orange glow effect when changing keybinds
  - **Keybind Persistence**: All keybinds saved to localStorage automatically
  - **No Restart Required**: Keybinds reload dynamically on next key press
  - **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents assigning the same key to multiple actions
- **Audio Management**:
  - Background music plays during main menu
  - Music automatically stops when entering first-person game mode
  - Music resets to beginning when stopped (ready for next menu session)
  - Ambient wind sound automatically starts when entering first-person mode
  - Ambient sound respects master audio toggle and volume settings
  - Smooth volume transitions and proper audio context handling
  - UI sound effects for button hover and click interactions
  - Hover sounds (900 Hz, 0.1s) and click sounds (500 Hz, 0.15s) using Tone.js
  - UI sounds respect master audio toggle and provide audio feedback for all interactions

## Distribution

### Windows Executable
The project can be packaged as a lightweight Windows executable using WebView2:
- **Build**: `dotnet build -c Release`
- **Package**: Run `portable\package-portable.bat` to create a distributable package
- **Output**: Creates `portable\` folder with all files ready for distribution
- **Size**: ~1-5MB (very lightweight!)
- **Requirements**: WebView2 Runtime (pre-installed on Windows 11)

See [PACKAGING.md](../PACKAGING.md) for detailed instructions.
