# My Thoughts

## Current Context
Refactored the Voxel Christmas project from a monolithic HTML file to a modular ES6 structure.
- **Date**: 2025-11-25
- **Status**: Refactor complete. Visual tweaks applied (snow intensity, house windows). Documentation updated.

## Recent Fixes
- **2025-01-XX**: Fixed volume slider bug where handle would jump to position 0 when grabbed. Solution was to update position immediately on mousedown instead of waiting for first mousemove event.

## Next Steps
- Await further user feedback.
