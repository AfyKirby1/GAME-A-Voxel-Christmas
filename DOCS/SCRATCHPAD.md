## 2025-01-XX: Loading Screen Bug Fixes

### Issues
1. **Loading Screen Not Hiding Menu**: The loading screen was not properly covering the main menu during world generation. Menu elements were visible behind/around the loading screen.
2. **Menu Flash After Generation**: After world generation completed, the main menu would briefly appear for ~600ms before entering first-person mode, creating a jarring transition.

### Root Causes
1. CSS structure issue: Loading screen base styles (position, size, background) were only in the `.world-loading-screen-hidden` class, causing them to be lost when switching to visible state.
2. Operation order issue: The code was hiding the loading screen *before* entering first-person mode, revealing the menu world during the transition delay.

### Solutions
1. **CSS Refactor** (`css/style.css`):
   - Moved base styles (position: fixed, width: 100%, height: 100%, background, etc.) to `#world-loading-screen` ID selector
   - Visibility classes now only control display, opacity, visibility, and z-index
   - Ensures loading screen always has proper dimensions and background

2. **UI Element Hiding** (`js/loading-screen.js`):
   - `showLoadingScreen()` now uses `!important` inline styles to force hide ALL UI elements
   - Targets: title-screen, menu-container, menu buttons, news-reel, audio-warning, UI buttons, panels, tech panel, countdown timer
   - Prevents any UI from showing through during generation

3. **Operation Order Fix** (`js/ui.js`):
   - Reordered operations: `enterFirstPersonMode()` now called *before* `hideLoadingScreen()`
   - Removed the 600ms delay that was causing the menu flash
   - Result: Game world is activated behind the loading screen, then loading screen fades out revealing game

4. **Smooth Fade-Out** (`js/loading-screen.js`):
   - `hideLoadingScreen()` now maintains `display: flex` during transition
   - Allows CSS opacity transition to work properly (0.5s fade)
   - Sets `display: none` after transition completes for complete removal

### Files Modified
- `css/style.css` - Refactored loading screen CSS structure
- `js/loading-screen.js` - Enhanced UI hiding with !important styles, restored fade-out transition
- `js/ui.js` - Fixed operation order (enter first-person mode before hiding loading screen)

### Result
- Loading screen now completely covers menu during generation
- Seamless transition from loading directly to gameplay
- No menu flash or visible menu world during transition
- Smooth fade-out animation when entering game

## 2025-01-XX: Preset Dropdown Bug Fix

### Issue
- Performance preset dropdown text would not update when changing presets (Low, Mid, High, Custom)
- Dropdown would always show "Custom" even when selecting Low, Mid, or High presets
- User could not see which preset was actually selected

### Root Cause
- `updateBloomSliderValue()` function was automatically setting preset to 'custom' whenever bloom intensity was updated
- When applying a preset, the code called `updateBloomSliderValue()` which immediately reset the preset dropdown to 'custom'
- This happened even though `isApplyingPreset` flag was set to prevent toggle handlers from changing the preset

### Solution
1. Added `skipPresetUpdate` parameter to `updateBloomSliderValue()` function
2. When calling `updateBloomSliderValue()` during preset application, pass `skipPresetUpdate = true`
3. Explicitly set preset value after all updates complete to ensure dropdown text is correct
4. This prevents bloom slider updates from interfering with preset selection

### Files Modified
- `js/ui.js` - Modified `updateBloomSliderValue()` to accept `skipPresetUpdate` parameter, updated preset change handler to pass flag and explicitly set preset value

### Result
- Preset dropdown now correctly displays selected preset (Low, Mid, High, or Custom)
- Preset selection works as expected without interference from bloom slider updates
- User can see which preset is active at all times

## 2025-01-XX: Volume Slider and Bloom Toggle Zero Value Bug Fix

### Critical Bugs Fixed
1. **Volume Slider at 0%**: Music would play at 100% volume when slider was at 0%
2. **Bloom Toggle at 0%**: Bloom effect would turn back on when toggled at 0% intensity

### Root Cause
- JavaScript's `||` operator treats `0` as falsy, so `0 || defaultValue` evaluates to `defaultValue`
- In `applyAudioSettings()`: `masterVolume || 1.0` and `musicVolume || 1.0` would default to `1.0` when volume was `0`
- In bloom intensity parsing: `parseFloat(value) || 0` could cause issues with falsy value handling
- This caused sliders/toggles at 0% to incorrectly use maximum values instead of respecting the zero setting

### Solution
1. **Volume Slider Fix**: Changed `|| 1.0` to `?? 1.0` (nullish coalescing) in `applyAudioSettings()` function
   - Nullish coalescing only treats `null` and `undefined` as falsy, preserving `0` as a valid value
   - Music now correctly respects 0% volume settings

2. **Bloom Intensity Fix**: Updated all 5 occurrences of bloom intensity parsing to explicitly check for `null`/`undefined`/`NaN`
   - Changed from: `parseFloat(bloomIntensityValue) || 0`
   - Changed to: Explicit null check with `isNaN()` validation
   - Bloom toggle now correctly respects 0% intensity settings

### Files Modified
- `js/ui.js` - Fixed `applyAudioSettings()` volume handling (line ~1098-1099)
- `js/ui.js` - Fixed all bloom intensity parsing (5 occurrences in toggle handlers)

### Result
- Volume sliders at 0% now correctly mute music instead of playing at 100%
- Bloom toggle at 0% intensity now correctly keeps bloom off instead of turning it back on
- Zero values are now properly preserved as valid settings throughout the UI

## 2025-01-XX: Volume Slider Bug - UNRESOLVED (OLD)

### Critical Bug: Music Plays at 0% Volume
- **Status**: RESOLVED - See fix above
- **Issue**: When dragging slider down to 0%, music continues playing
- **Root Cause**: Slider handle width (18px) causes calculated values to be 0.02-0.05 instead of 0
- **Attempted Fixes**: 8 different approaches, all failed
- **Current State**: All thresholds set to 0.05 (5%), localStorage fallback fixed, but drag-down still fails

## 2025-01-XX: Volume Slider Bug Fix (OLD - INCOMPLETE)

### Issue
- Volume slider handle would jump to position 0 when grabbing/dragging
- Caused by delayed position update - code waited for first mousemove event

### Solution
- Updated `startDrag()` function to immediately call `updateFromEvent()` on mousedown
- Prevents incorrect position calculation on first mouse movement
- Handle now stays at current position when grabbed, allowing smooth dragging

### Files Modified
- `js/ui.js` - Fixed `startDrag()` function in `setupVolumeSlider()`

## 2025-11-25: WebGL-Only Implementation

## 2025-01-XX: News Reel Enhancements

### RGB LED Border System
- **Outer Glow**: Double-box technique using `::before` pseudo-element with animated linear gradient
- **Border Lights**: `::after` pseudo-element with repeating linear gradient creating bar light effect
- **Animation Speeds**: Optimized for smooth visual flow (6s, 20s, 16s cycles)

### Dynamic Snowflake System
- **Implementation**: JavaScript-based spawning system in `setupNewsReelSnowflakes()`
- **Features**:
  - Random horizontal spawn positions within container bounds
  - Individual animation durations (6-8 seconds)
  - Smooth rotation and horizontal drift during fall
  - Automatic cleanup on animation end
  - Continuous spawning loop with random intervals (0.5-1.5s)
  - Maximum 7 concurrent snowflakes for performance

### CSS Animation Details
- **Snowflake Animation**: Pixel-based `translateY` values (0px to 48px) for precise control
- **Opacity Curve**: High visibility (0.8) maintained until 85% of animation, then gradual fade
- **Rotation**: Continuous 540-degree rotation during fall for natural movement

## 2025-01-XX: Escape Key and Quit to Menu Fixes

### Issues Fixed
1. **Escape Key Double-Press**: Required two escape presses - first unlocked pointer, second showed pause menu
2. **Quit to Menu Broken**: Quit to menu button didn't properly clean up game session and restore UI
3. **UI Not Restored**: UI elements didn't appear correctly when returning to main menu
4. **Countdown Timer Not Restarting**: Timer didn't restart when returning to menu

### Solutions

#### 1. Escape Key Fix (`js/main.js`, `js/ui.js`)
- **Problem**: Browser's default escape behavior unlocked pointer before our handler ran, requiring two presses
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated escape handler to explicitly check pause state and call `pauseGame()` or `resumeGame()`
  - Added auto-pause listener on pointer unlock events (handles browser default unlock)
  - Added `isHandlingPause` flag to prevent race conditions between escape handler and unlock listener
  - Now pauses immediately on first escape press

#### 2. Quit to Menu Cleanup (`js/main.js`, `js/ui.js`)
- **Problem**: Camera not reset, orbit controls not restored, game world still visible, panels not closed
- **Solution**:
  - **Camera Reset**: Resets camera position to menu view (75, 45, 75)
  - **Orbit Controls**: Re-enables with auto-rotate and resets target to menu center
  - **Game World**: Hides game world container so only menu world is visible
  - **State Flags**: Resets `isHandlingPause` flag
  - **Panels**: Closes all panels (settings, gallery, tech, world-gen) before UI restoration

#### 3. UI Restoration (`js/ui.js`)
- **Problem**: Loading screen `!important` styles blocking UI elements, incomplete restoration
- **Solution**:
  - Exported `showUI()` function for centralized restoration
  - Added cleanup of all `!important` inline styles from loading screen
  - Ensures canvas visibility when returning to menu
  - Closes all panels before UI restoration
  - Uses centralized `showUI()` function for complete, consistent restoration

#### 4. Countdown Timer Restart (`js/ui.js`)
- **Problem**: Timer stopped but never restarted when returning to menu
- **Solution**:
  - Resets timer element (removes classes, resets text to '5', makes visible)
  - Calls `setupCountdownTimer()` after UI restoration with 100ms delay
  - Timer now restarts automatically for auto-hide functionality

### Files Modified
- `js/main.js` - Added camera/orbit reset, game world hiding, pause handling improvements
- `js/ui.js` - Exported `showUI()`, improved quit-to-menu handler, timer restart logic

### Result
- ✅ Escape key pauses immediately on first press
- ✅ Quit to menu properly cleans up game session
- ✅ UI fully restored when returning to main menu
- ✅ Countdown timer restarts automatically
- ✅ All panels properly closed
- ✅ Camera and controls properly reset to menu state

## 2025-01-XX: WASD Movement and Keybind System

### Implementation
1. **Keybind Configuration System** (`js/config.js`):
   - Default keybind mappings (W, A, S, D, Space)
   - `loadKeybinds()`: Loads from localStorage or returns defaults
   - `saveKeybinds()`: Saves to localStorage
   - `getKeyDisplayName()`: Converts key codes to display names
   - Key display name mapping for common keys (W, A, S, D, Space, Arrow keys, modifiers)

2. **Movement System** (`js/first-person-controls.js`):
   - Movement state tracking (keys currently pressed)
   - Movement constants: speed (5.0), jump speed (8.0), gravity (20.0), eye height (1.6)
   - `updateMovement(deltaTime)`: Calculates movement direction based on camera rotation
   - Ground collision using `getGroundHeight()` callback
   - Keyboard event listeners (keydown/keyup) that reload keybinds dynamically
   - Movement respects camera rotation (forward = camera direction)
   - Horizontal movement normalized to prevent faster diagonal movement
   - Vertical movement with gravity and jump mechanics

3. **Movement Integration** (`js/main.js`):
   - DeltaTime calculation in animation loop (capped at 100ms)
   - `updateMovement(deltaTime)` called in first-person mode
   - Ground collision callback passed to FirstPersonControls constructor
   - Keybinds reloaded when entering first-person mode

4. **Interactive Keybind UI** (`js/ui.js`):
   - `setupControlsPanel()`: Initializes keybind UI
   - Loads and displays current keybinds from localStorage
   - Click-to-change functionality on `.keybind-key` elements
   - "Listening" state with visual feedback (CSS class)
   - One-time keydown listener for keybind capture
   - Duplicate keybind prevention with conflict message
   - Automatic UI update and localStorage save
   - Escape key to cancel keybind change

5. **Visual Feedback** (`css/style.css`):
   - `.keybind-key.listening` class with pulsing animation
   - Orange glow effect (color: #ffaa00) with box-shadow
   - `@keyframes keybindPulse`: 1.5s infinite animation
   - Scale transform (1.05) for emphasis
   - Smooth transitions for state changes
   - Hover effects work with listening state

6. **HTML Structure** (`index.html`):
   - Added `data-keybind` attributes to keybind items
   - Identifies movement actions (forward, backward, left, right, jump)

### Features
- ✅ WASD movement with configurable keybinds
- ✅ Ground collision detection
- ✅ Jump mechanics with gravity
- ✅ Frame-independent movement (deltaTime)
- ✅ Interactive keybind UI with visual feedback
- ✅ localStorage persistence
- ✅ Dynamic keybind reloading (no restart needed)
- ✅ Duplicate keybind prevention
- ✅ Key display name mapping for UI

### Technical Details
- Movement speed: 5.0 units/second
- Jump speed: 8.0 units/second (initial velocity)
- Gravity: 20.0 units/s²
- Player eye height: 1.6 units above ground
- DeltaTime capped at 100ms to prevent large jumps on frame drops
- Keybinds reloaded on each key press for immediate effect
- Movement only active when pointer is locked (first-person mode)
